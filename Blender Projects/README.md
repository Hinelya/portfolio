# Blender Projects

This folder contains my Blender-based 3D modeling work.

## About
Here you’ll find some of the 3D models and rendered images I have created so far while learning and improving my skills in Blender.
The focus of these projects is practicing modeling, texturing, lighting, and rendering.

## Contents
- 3D models created in Blender
- Rendered images of the models
- Organized project files related to each model

## Purpose
These projects are part of my personal learning journey in 3D modeling and visual design. Each model reflects my progress and experimentation with different techniques and styles.

## Status
This folder is actively updated as I create new models and improve existing ones.
