# Unity Game Projects

This folder contains my Unity-based game development projects.

## About
Here you’ll find small-scale games and gameplay prototypes I have developed while improving my skills in Unity and C#.  
The focus of these projects is understanding core game mechanics, system design, and clean scripting practices.

## Contents
- Unity project source files (Assets, ProjectSettings, Packages)
- C# gameplay scripts
- Scenes and prefabs
- UI elements and basic game systems
- Screenshots of the games 

## Technical Focus
These projects include implementations of:
- Physics-based player movement
- Collision and trigger detection
- Score and game state management
- Basic UI systems
- GameManager architecture

## Purpose
These projects represent my learning journey in game development.  
Each project is built to strengthen my understanding of Unity architecture, object-oriented programming, and gameplay system design.

## Status
This folder is actively updated as I create new prototypes and improve existing systems.
