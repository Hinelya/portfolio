# Roll-a-Ball

My first simple 3D physics-based collection game developed with Unity.

## Game Overview
In this game, the player controls a sphere on a flat platform and collects rotating cubes scattered around the scene.  
Each collected cube increases the score. When all cubes are collected, the game ends.

## Core Mechanics
- Rigidbody-based player movement
- Physics interaction system
- Rotating collectible objects
- Trigger-based collision detection
- Score tracking system
- Win condition logic

## Technical Implementation
- Centralized GameManager for handling game state
- Modular player controller script
- UI updates based on gameplay events
- Organized project structure for scalability

## Controls
- Move: WASD or Arrow Keys

## Technologies Used
- Unity Engine
- C#
- Unity Physics System
- Unity UI System

## Purpose
This project was created to strengthen my understanding of core Unity systems such as physics, collision detection, scripting architecture, and game state management.

It represents a foundational step in building structured and scalable gameplay systems.
